Documentation of my Code-

In this program, we created a Library Database Management System. we used username and password as a gateway to access the database,
so that only some people can access it, then we have introduced many different functions to perform the task as it can store data and 
then we can also view that data and can search specific piece of data and can delete a specific data as well. we have also provided
to let the user temporarily change the password of the database inside the running program without tempering with the code.

CREATED using 'C Language'
